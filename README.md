mart Will
Project Description
Smart Will is a blockchain-based platform that enables users to create and manage smart contract-based wills securely. By leveraging decentralized technology, Smart Will ensures that the will execution process is immutable, transparent, and tamper-proof.

Project Vision
The goal of Smart Will is to revolutionize traditional estate planning by providing a trustless and automated solution that removes the need for intermediaries, reduces legal complexities, and ensures asset distribution according to the owner's wishes.

Future Scope
Multi-Beneficiary Support: Enable multiple beneficiaries to receive assets based on predefined conditions.
Time-Based Execution: Implement time-lock functionality to trigger will execution at a specified future date.
Integration with Digital Identity Solutions: Link will authentication with decentralized identity verification.
AI-Powered Recommendations: Suggest optimal will structuring based on user preferences and asset types.
Multi-Chain Support: Extend compatibility with different blockchain networks.
Key Features
Immutable Will Storage: Ensures that once recorded, the will cannot be altered or deleted.
Owner-Only Execution: Only the owner of the will has the right to execute it.
Tamper-Proof Events: Uses blockchain-based event logging for transparency.
Smart Contract Automation: Eliminates intermediaries, ensuring the will is executed as per predefined conditions.
Public Readability: Allows beneficiaries to verify the will's existence and content (if made public by the owner).
